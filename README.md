Vireka Jewelry Store is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application built using React. This project simulates a small-scale online jewelry store, allowing users to browse a wide range of jewelry products, view detailed information, and add items to a shopping cart. It demonstrates my skills in front-end development, state management using React Context, and dynamic user interface design.  

The application features a clean, interactive layout with reusable components, a user chat module for real-time interaction, and a seamless checkout experience. It is fully deployed on Vercel for live access.

## Project Overview
Vireka Jewelry Store is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application built with React.  
This project showcases my skills in **front-end development**, **state management**, and **dynamic UI design** while simulating a small-scale online jewelry store.  

**User Interaction Flow:**  
- **Browse Products:** Users can view a grid of jewelry products with images, prices, and stock availability.  
- **View Product Details:** Clicking on a product opens a detailed modal showing description, manufacturer, price, and stock.  
- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to the shopping cart directly from the product card or the details modal. Stock decreases dynamically as items are added.  
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:** Users can see the cart contents, remove items, and simulate payment using a checkout form.  
- **User Chat:** Users can interact with a chat component, select categories (e.g., Necklace, Bangles, Accessories), and type messages for queries or assistance.  

This flow ensures a realistic and interactive online shopping experience while demonstrating dynamic state handling and responsive design.
